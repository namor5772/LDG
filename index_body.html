<p>Artist</p>

<p>Born: January 28, 1933; Żółkiew, Poland</p>

<p>Died: February 16, 2012; Adelaide, Australia</p>   
    
<p>Lidia was born near Lwów in what was then Eastern Poland, and grew up in Krzemieniec
- both towns now in the Ukraine. Her family fled the Soviet annexation of
eastern Poland in 1939 to Nowy Sącz, south of Kraków.</p>

<p>As a young adult she studied at the Kraków Academy of Fine Art from 1951-57,
specialising in graphic arts, and attracted to the woodcut in particular. She
also studied painting and Polish folk art and constantly produced sketches.
Schooled in the preferred Communist style of Social Realist art, many of her
sketches were of peasant workers in the fields and villages where she would
walk. She would later describe these extensive collections of sketches as "semi-product",
 and she used them as a reference point for inspiration for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>In 1957 she was invited to London to stay with the Groblickis, who had managed an epic
escape over 10 years via Siberian, Persian and Indian refugee camps. There she
met the Groblickis' son, motor mechanic Tadeusz. The two married in 1958.</p>

<p>Living in England as the young mother of Roman, born in 1959, she felt challenged and
alienated, and her work became charged with homesickness and nostalgia. The
family decided to migrate to Australia in 1967, and settled in Adelaide the
following year.</p>

<p>In Adelaide she struggled to be recognised as an artist of substance at first. She
showed some paintings and prints at the Royal SA Society of the Arts, where the
commercial gallery director Rachel Biven recognised her talent. Her first
exhibition at Biven's gallery quickly sold out, giving her a chance to
establish herself, and she was soon being seen in solo and group shows both in
Australia and overseas, including Poland. The Art Gallery of SA and the
National Gallery of Australia hold extensive collections of her prints. By the
early 1970s she had been made a fellow of the RSASA and would eventually become
a life member. Her prints often reflected her views, and in one series of
prints of trees, she depicted her life and the violent swings in mood she
experienced, both with humour and joy in works such as <em>Sun Tree</em> and
despair, in <em>Crying Tree</em>.</p>

<p>Australian themes infiltrated her art, including more critical commentary on Australian
suburbia, but even though she came to love Australia's wide open arid lands,
she found it difficult to sketch Australian subjects, and kept to her Polish
homeland for inspiration.</p>
 
<p>While her woodblock prints are exclusively black and white, she would turn to paint
to produce colourful works that have been keenly collected.</p>
